# polyprotein_stats
A small tool to test and visualize protein embeddings and amino acid proportions.

Currently deployed on [streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/leonfrench/polyprotein_stats/main/protein_embeddings_app.py).

Given a set of proteins, this tool seeks to answer these questions:

* is there a enrichment of one or two amino acids? 
* can amino acid proportions, plus sequence length discriminate the input proteins from the rest of the proteome?
* can the averaged per residue embeddings from a deep neural network discriminate the input proteins from the rest of the proteome?

Embeddings for the human proteins is from the ProtT5 embedder at full precision (prottrans_t5_xl_u50 model) that were 
generated by Christian Dallago and Burkhard Rost ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5047020#.YgQ_fe7MI-R)).
